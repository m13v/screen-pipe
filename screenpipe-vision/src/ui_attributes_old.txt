PRINCIPLES: 
atomic, playable, fast, closest to money

DAILY ROUTINE
talk to users
code
post

PRIORITIES
talk to users
makes things reliable
test locally different scenarios (remember how i forgot to include vad_engine, cli code)
run all benchmarks before trying to merge
use enums instead of strings (we're not writing python or JS, save time) and use rust feats to easily convert to string for db
separate concerns / code, we should never have files with more than 500 lines of code, db is for db code, server for api code, etc.
write unit tests when there are more than 10 possible edge cases and it's inefficient to test manually and faster to test with unit test (dont test UI). very often it's faster to write tests than testing manually
use debug more when doing unit tests (it's veryyyyy useful, happy to share how)
we should name things around human senses (e.g. vision, audio, not "frames", my bad starting like this)
do not use mutex if we can avoid it (ask chatgpt why mutexes are anti pattern)
avoid nesting if, matches, whatever, it makes thing very complex
properly handle errors (no .expect, it crashes the program, use match)
use anyhow for errors and if possible implement custom error when it make sense
avoid functions with more than 5 args as much as possible, find other solution
always try to remove code rather than adding
always try to leave the code better, easier to read for humans, and efficient to execute for computers
figure out how to use tracing lib from rust well
use linter and set cursor to lint on cmd + s
IMPORTANT: keep things simple. if a user want something implement the dumb easy solution first then iterate (DONT OVERENGINEER)
make integrations easily removable from code
use "feature" of rust for things, (for integrations for examples) to easily remove things
api and things exposed to users should be INSANELY great UX, ask chatgpt best practices and 20 suggestions and pick best one
also we have definitely awful usage of data structures atm (100% my bad), most data structures are not adapted for code that run 24/7 with massive data in/out


QUESTIONS:
should we put it into a separate pipe: Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Cosine Similarity with TS-IDF

- review results, delete rubbish
- save results back to json
- what fields to delete, which ones to add: e.g. events, tasks, meetings
- include existing context in ai call
- examples
- here you have a field "name" and value for each keyword, in this example value is "Matthew". Does this satisfy the field name? or should you continue search? Respond only with one word: STOP or CONTINUE
- update: we run getUserContent and then if there was a value inside json before, we compare the new resultDeduplicated with what we had in this field before
- Information reranking: facts, novelty, significance
- remove openai stuff
- try 405b quantized?
- date when it was run

SCREENPIPE
PRINCIPLES: 
atomic, playable, fast, closest to money

DAILY ROUTINE
talk to users
code
post

PRIORITIES
talk to users
makes things reliable
test locally different scenarios (remember how i forgot to include vad_engine, cli code)
run all benchmarks before trying to merge
use enums instead of strings (we're not writing python or JS, save time) and use rust feats to easily convert to string for db
separate concerns / code, we should never have files with more than 500 lines of code, db is for db code, server for api code, etc.
write unit tests when there are more than 10 possible edge cases and it's inefficient to test manually and faster to test with unit test (dont test UI). very often it's faster to write tests than testing manually
use debug more when doing unit tests (it's veryyyyy useful, happy to share how)
we should name things around human senses (e.g. vision, audio, not "frames", my bad starting like this)
do not use mutex if we can avoid it (ask chatgpt why mutexes are anti pattern)
avoid nesting if, matches, whatever, it makes thing very complex
properly handle errors (no .expect, it crashes the program, use match)
use anyhow for errors and if possible implement custom error when it make sense
avoid functions with more than 5 args as much as possible, find other solution
always try to remove code rather than adding
always try to leave the code better, easier to read for humans, and efficient to execute for computers
figure out how to use tracing lib from rust well
use linter and set cursor to lint on cmd + s
IMPORTANT: keep things simple. if a user want something implement the dumb easy solution first then iterate (DONT OVERENGINEER)
make integrations easily removable from code
use "feature" of rust for things, (for integrations for examples) to easily remove things
api and things exposed to users should be INSANELY great UX, ask chatgpt best practices and 20 suggestions and pick best one
also we have definitely awful usage of data structures atm (100% my bad), most data structures are not adapted for code that run 24/7 with massive data in/out


QUESTIONS:
should we put it into a separate pipe: Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Cosine Similarity with TS-IDF

TESTING
push and see

website: check all pages, buttons, links

- ui to run memories for a specific category
- identify projects
- which deps to use in the project
- common file across the team
- human ground truth, annotations: delete/edit/confirm/try again
- story: i did a few projects, neither worked, so i thought, the most dumb simple thing that can increase my productivity by 10%
- demo: before/after
..
- nextjs pipe
- review results, delete rubbish
- save results back to json
- what fields to delete, which ones to add: e.g. events, tasks, meetings
- include existing context in ai call
- examples
- here you have a field "name" and value for each keyword, in this example value is "Matthew". Does this satisfy the field name? or should you continue search? Respond only with one word: STOP or CONTINUE
- update: we run getUserContent and then if there was a value inside json before, we compare the new resultDeduplicated with what we had in this field before
- Information reranking: facts, novelty, significance
- remove openai stuff
- try 405b quantized?
- date when it was run
- create new keywords if all filled out?
- search by app/window?
- store source
- periodic querying
- autofill (repetative inputs)
- use again generateText, generateObject?
- config: smlr thrshold 25%

return beta
remind when screenpipe is not running
build as Tanuj suggested
reddits that don't require karma to post
doesn't work, beta can be enable only with screenpipe cloud, privacy policy doesn't open, remove api key field, do i need to press save?
GitHub can take a while to update contribution graphs
get back to tanuj, share with him the new pipe
double slash
reference Tanuj's python sdk
giraffe note to go back into this chunk
Furqan meeting recap, schedule another one
Chat with matt.screenpipe (work hours) system prompt to prevent pii but if u insist, pii filter prompt, approve/edit
stargazer new newsletter (re-run main, hey there, check that emails are sent, add main.py to github actions)
[SWIFT OUTPUT] google-forms (check social media account flw/created, add to loops, trigger 'what made you interested in screenpipe?', 'can you try the app and post about it on your social media today/tomorrow?', 'here is the download link, let me know if it works, the app is still an alpha version. once you try it, please make a post and share a link to it with me')
